Congratulations on your first plugin skill! Here's my honest feedback:

  What Worked Well

  - Clear structure - The skill had well-organized sections (Environment Validation, Data Validation, Examples)
  - Comprehensive checks - It covered all the right things: Python version, modules, dependencies, CSV format, actual
  Bandicoot load test
  - Good documentation - The "Common Issues and Fixes" section is genuinely useful

  Why I Needed the Temporary Scripts

  The skill provided Python code as templates/documentation rather than executable artifacts. The issue:

  1. Windows + conda + inline Python = pain - Running multi-line Python via conda run -n bandicoot python -c "..." on
  Windows has quoting nightmares (PowerShell escaping, nested quotes, etc.)
  2. The skill assumed I'd figure out execution - The code blocks were presented as "here's what to run" but not
  packaged in a runnable way

  Suggestions to Improve

  Option A: Include the scripts as files in your plugin
  bandicoot-plugin/
    skills/
      validate.md
    scripts/
      validate_env.py
      validate_data.py

  Then the skill can reference: "Run conda run -n bandicoot python {plugin_path}/scripts/validate_env.py"

  Option B: Simpler, single-purpose commands

  Instead of one big validation script, break into small inline-safe commands:
  conda run -n bandicoot python -c "import bandicoot; print(bandicoot.__version__)"

  Option C: Have the skill instruct me to create the script

  Explicitly say: "Create a file called validate.py with the following content, then run it."

  The Core Issue

  The skill told me what to validate but left how to execute it ambiguous. For cross-platform reliability, either:
  - Ship executable scripts with the plugin
  - Use very simple one-liner commands
  - Or explicitly instruct to create temp files (which is what I ended up doing anyway)

  Would you like help restructuring the skill to include the scripts properly?

> the AI models that might run this plugin/skills might not be clause code calibur all the time, so do you think
  executable scripts with the plugin would be best?

● Exactly right. If a less capable model tries to run this skill, it might:

  - Get stuck on the Windows quoting issues I hit
  - Not think to create temporary files as a workaround
  - Misinterpret the code blocks as "informational" rather than "executable"
  - Fail silently and not know how to recover

  Executable scripts are the safest approach. The skill becomes:

  1. Simple instruction: "Run this script"
  2. Predictable path: The model just needs to execute one command
  3. All logic contained: The script handles edge cases, formatting, error messages

  Suggested Structure

  bandicoot-plugin/
    skills/
      validate.md          # Just says "run the script, here's what args mean"
    scripts/
      validate.py          # Does everything - env check, data check, args parsing

  The Skill Becomes Much Simpler

  # Bandicoot: Validate

  Validate your Bandicoot environment and data files.

  ## Usage

  conda run -n bandicoot python {scripts}/validate.py [options]

  ## Options
  - `--env-only` - Only check environment, skip data validation
  - `--user USER_ID` - User ID to validate
  - `--data PATH` - Path to data directory
  - `--antennas PATH` - Path to antennas file

  ## Examples

  # Environment only
  conda run -n bandicoot python {scripts}/validate.py --env-only

  # Validate specific user
  conda run -n bandicoot python {scripts}/validate.py --user sample_user_PRIMARY --data data/

  The script I wrote during validation is essentially what you'd ship. Want me to create a proper validate.py with
  argument parsing that you can include in your plugin?
